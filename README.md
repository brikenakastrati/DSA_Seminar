# AVL Tree Performance Comparison
### This repository implements AVL trees over two types of binary trees:
### 1.Reference-based Binary Tree: Uses class-based nodes
### 2.Array-based Binary Tree: Uses arrays to represent the binary tree structure.

### The project compares time and memory complexities of AVL tree operations (insert, delete, search) on both implementations. The repository also includes datasets for experiments and visualizations of tree operations using Graphviz.
